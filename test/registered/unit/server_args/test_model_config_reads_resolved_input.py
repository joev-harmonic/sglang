"""`ModelConfig` is built from values resolution has already decided.

Resolution builds a `ModelConfig` partway through and keys later decisions off
it, so the pipeline reads its own output through that object. The loop is only
benign while every field `ModelConfig.from_server_args` reads has been resolved
by the time it is built -- otherwise the model configuration describes a
half-resolved input, and every handler downstream of it inherits that.

Nothing enforces the ordering today; it holds because the path and quantization
handlers happen to run early. So this derives both sides from the source -- the
fields the constructor reads, and the step each is declared at -- and pins the
one field that is deliberately read before resolution touches it.

# Nothing reads the stale copy today: `ModelConfig.speculative_algorithm` has
